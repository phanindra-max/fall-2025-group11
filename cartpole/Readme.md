Notes:

- Gymnasium is the library that provides reinforcement learning environments 
- optional dependencies can be added between [] while running pip command
- 'pip install "gymnasium[classic-control]"' - to download 'classic-control' package additionally. It consists of classic control environments like cartpole, mountaincar, acrobat, pendulum. These are not downloaded by default if we just run pip install gymnaisum
- make() is used to initialise environment -> gymnasium.Env
- The environment class has API methods  that can be used to interact with the environment:
  - reset(): reset environment to initial state. returns:
    - first agent observation for an episode
    - information from environment i.e metrics, debug info
  - step(): updates an environment with action. returns:
    - next agent observation 
    - reward for taking action
    - if environment has terminated or truncated dur to latest action
    - information from environment about the step
  - render(): determines if we want to see a visual window or array or no visual representation 
  - close(): closes the environment
- Attributes of environment class that can be used:
  - action_space: space object related to valid actions
  - observation_space: space object related to valid observations
  - spec: environment spec required to initialize the environment using make()
  - metadata: metadata of environment
  - np_random: random number generator
